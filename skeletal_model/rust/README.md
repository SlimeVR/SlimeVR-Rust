# ü¶Ä Ferrous SimeVR Skeletal Model
A WIP implementation of a new full-body tracking skeletal model & solver in Rust,
for use in Virtual Reality.

> This is *not* the official skeletal model for SlimeVR, that model is
> [here][official model], intertwined deep in the official SlimeVR Server
> codebase. This alternative implementation seeks to improve on the official one
> and experiment with some new concepts.


## üìù How does it work?
Its worth reading the documentation [here][docs], lots of time has been spent to
explain how it works.


## üî≠ Goals
* Written in Rust, callable by all[^1] languages.
* Single purpose, *just* the math. Leave other tasks like networking and IO up to the
  user of the library.
* Run on all platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Oculus Quest, Steam Deck,
  WebAssembly etc.
* High performance, no language runtime or JVM, embed it in your program as a native
  library.
* Help others build on top of our work, including non-rust developers. We want to
  spread affordable full-body tracking to as many people as possible.
* Extensive [documentation][docs], easily understood by non-rustaceans. This will
  ensure that even non-experts can help contribute and improve things for the community.
* Leverage good [math][nalgebra] and [graph][daggy] libraries to make the math and 
  algorithims easy.


## üöß Implementation Status
We are under active development. If you love Rust, math, or full-body tracking, please
reach out and help make this a reality!

- [X] Graph datastructure and associated data implemented.
- [X] Everything well documented.
- [X] Supports basic positional constraints (Vive trackers).
- [X] Supports rotational constraints (SlimeVR trackers).
- [ ] Implement solver to turn the constraints into the estimated skeleton pose.
- [ ] Align tracker inputs (IMU yaw alignment).
- [ ] Provide TypeScript/Node.js bindings.
- [ ] Validate that the library works by using it in a TypeScript or Rust implementation
  of the SlimeVR server.
- [ ] Provide Java bindings.
- [ ] Integration with official SlimeVR [Server][java server]. [^2]


[^1]: For now, "all" means Typescript, and then later, Java. If you have a language
you are passionate about using this in, just file an issue!

[^2]: This is both unlikely and also not strictly necessary. The [creator][eiren] of
SlimeVR has stated that they have no interest in using anything other than Java for the
SlimeVR server. This doesn't satisfy the goals outlined above, so we will instead implement
a version of the SlimeVR server in TypeScript to directly build on our work here. There may
still be a chance that this can be integrated into the official server behind some
compilation or feature flags. It might instead get ported by others to Java directly, instead
of using FFI bindings.
