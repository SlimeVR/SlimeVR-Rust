# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this project! This document describes
what you need to know to get started with the code.


## Installing the dependencies

First, install the `Rust` programming language by following the instructions at
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

Next, install `libclang`, which is used by the
[`ovr_overlay`](https://crates.io/crates/ovr_overlay) bindings for OpenVR. For windows,
use [this] link. For Linux, simply `sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev`.

You will also need SteamVR installed.

### Steam Deck

If you are building on the steam deck, be sure that you have all the necessary libraries
for native development installed. To get them, follow [these] instructions.

## Building

`cargo` is the build tool for rust. You can `cargo run` to run the code, `cargo check`
to check if your code compiles, and `cargo test` to run tests. You can also do
`--release` to generate an optimized release mode version. This will take longer to
compile but will run significantly faster.


## Documentation

Documentation is autogenerated by cargo and can be viewed in a web browser with
`cargo doc --all --open --no-deps --document-private-items`. You can run
`cargo doc --help` to learn more about what those flags do. The documentation is also
automatically published to github pages for every commit on the `main` branch [here].

## Code Style

All code is autoformatted by `cargo fmt`. We suggest turning on autoformatting on save
in your IDE, otherwise you can just run `cargo fmt` on the command line. Also, all files
should end in a newline and have extra whitespace trimmed.

Its also a good idea to run `cargo clippy` to fix the style lints it generates.
