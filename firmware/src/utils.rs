/// - `n` is the number of times to retry. `0` means no retries will be attempted, so
///   `f` will only be called once.
/// - `acc` is an "accumulator" which repeatedly gets passeed to the function each time
/// it is called.
/// - `f` is the function to retry.
/// - `before_retry(retry_num)` is a function that gets called right before invoking `f`
///   again on a retry. `retry_num` goes from `0..n`. Often useful for logging or
///   controlling a delay between invocations of `f`.
