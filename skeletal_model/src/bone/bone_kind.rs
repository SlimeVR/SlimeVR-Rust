/// Describes the various types of bones in the skeleton.

/// All of this information is static rather than dynamic information. "Static" here

/// - The parent/child relationships between the various types of bones
/// - The pose of the bones when performing a calibration
/// - Names of the bones
/// - Etc
///
/// Where possible, this information is provided as [`const`] functions so that they
/// can be evaluated at compile-time.
///
/// There is also dynamic information associated with bones. "Dynamic" here refers to
/// the fact that some bone data cannot be known up front and changes as the skeletal
/// model receives inputs and produces outputs. This data is stored in the
/// [`Skeleton`](crate::Skeleton) as an [`Edge`](crate::skeleton::Edge).
///
/// `BoneKind` is also represented as a `u8`, so it can be used as an index for an
/// array. This is used for example in [`BoneMap`]. **Please note that we make no
/// stability guarantees for the particular value that any variant gets, only that
/// these values are contiguous and start at 0.** Use the variant directly or refer to
/// the various functions implemented on this type for stability.
